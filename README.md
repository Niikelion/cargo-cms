# Cargo CMS
`Cargo` is an open-source project of a CMS service
designed to improve the experience of working with data,
providing ability to store full objects, media,
and fully customize the types and interface to your hearts content.

## Current status

`Cargo` is currently in the POC stage.
It supports table generation from schema files,
querying, deleting and inserting data using direct and rest api.
It was only tested using `sqlite` database,
but closer to first full release it will be tested on more databases.

## Roadmap

* Partial update
* Admin panel
* API playground
* Separation of `Cargo` as library and service
* Documentation and examples
* Separate library for interfacing with `Cargo`
* React library for embedding `Cargo`-based editable fields into your website

## License

As of now, `Cargo` is under [MIT](LICENSE) license,
for you to use completely free of charge in private and commercial products,
and it won't be changed retroactively.

This project will be monetized in some way in the future,
but as it is only a POC I'm not sure what will be the exact terms of future licenses.

## Contributing

Right now I'm only accepting issues,
as unit tests and GitHub pipelines are not currently set up.
